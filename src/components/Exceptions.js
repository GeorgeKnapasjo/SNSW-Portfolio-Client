                <h4>Throwing exceptions</h4>
                <p>
                Errors in code are usually referred to as exceptions. If we wish to throw an error we use the throw keyword. We may want to throw an error where, for example, if we are expecting a number to be entered by the user and they enter a string. Generally, when we want to throw an error, we also use the Error keyword as this will provide us more information on whatâ€™s gone wrong and wear.

                <h4>Try/Catch/Finally</h4>
                <p>A try/catch/finally statement is used for error/exception handling. Code is written in the try statement, if we hit an error in this code, it will be caught in the catch statement. Regardless of whether the error is resolved or not the finally statement will execute. The try/catch/finally statement is useful as if we are to hit an error, it will not cause the code to stop working</p>

            <h2>Thank You</h2>
            <p>I would like to take the opportunity to thank those who were involved with putting together the coding bootcamp. Over the last 3 months I've learnt so much and have enjoyed challenging myself with this opportunity. I look forward to my future career in tehcnology and am excited to see where it takes me. I'd also like to thank Trent, Melissa and Belinda for the weekly meetings, where you listened and responded to our feedback and provided us with reassurance that we can get through it. I'm very proud of myself for finishing this course and am very appreciative of the opportunity.
